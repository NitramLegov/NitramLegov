## Hi folks, IÂ´m Martin
IÂ´m a Nerd, a Maker and a Management Consultant.

In my spare time, I am helping out as one of three active managers of [CoMakingSpace](https://github.com/comakingspace/), a community run makerspace in Heidelberg. Go check it out, itÂ´s awesome!

### Tech Stuff I like

* Microcontrollers (those tiny little things are poooowerfull)
* Raspberry Pis (we all do, donÂ´t we?)
* Python 
* .Net
* [homeassistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) (Core install running on podman, I dislike HassOS)
* Rootless(!) containers

### Stuff I dislike

* Fany open-source projects not being maintained anymore (ðŸ˜¢)
* Days having only 24 hours (Dear universe, when am I supposed to finish my projects?)
